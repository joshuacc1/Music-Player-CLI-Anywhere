## About

Terminal User Interfaces (TUI) often have an advantage over windows in that they can use a UTF-8 based console requiring minimal set of resources to provide a user ineractive interface. Often TUI applications can run in almost any environment and do not require installation.

What if you just wanted to play files in a box, like, say a folder? You may find yourself in this situation where you want to listen to a few files in a folder without going through the difficulty of loading a fully featured program and loading the file with all the advertisements and glitzyness, whatever, you just want to quickly play the dang file.
