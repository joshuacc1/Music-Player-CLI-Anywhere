## About

Terminal User Interfaces (TUI) often have an advantage over windows in that they can use a UTF-8 based console requiring minimal set of resources to provide a user ineractive interface. Often TUI applications can run in almost any environment and do not require installation.

What if you wanted a simple application that you can just drop into a folder and play its music? You may find yourself in this situation when you are on a computer that you want to play music without installing any programs or just want to sample wave files without loading a fully featured music application. Wouldn't you like something that you could just quickly play music that you found?

We have the solution for you. CUI Anywhere Music Player (CAMP) will play music wherever you place the executible. Place it in any folder, and it will automatically find the songs in that folder to play it. It comes with all the basic features of music queing, play, pause, skip, and volume controls. It plays a wide range of formats like .mp3, .wav, .flac, etc. Play music in an instant with this simple CUI music app.
